# UI Fragmentation
This repository contains an example of fragmenting a user interface into selective components to improve readability and maintainability.
 

 ## Before
The `before` folder contains the original code snippet before the UI fragmentation.

## After
The `after` folder contains the code after fragmenting the UI into selective components.

### Components Created

- **BurnButtonBar** :  Handles the UI for the burn button bar.

- **BurnStatsContainer**: Manages the UI for displaying burn statistics.

## Justification

Fragmenting the UI into components offers the several benefits like :

1. **Improved Readability**:When we break the user interface into smaller parts, it becomes simpler to see what each piece does.

2. **Maintainability**:Each component encapsulates its own logic and presentation, making it easier to update and maintain in the future.

3. **Reusability**:Instead of writing the same code for similar parts of the interface, we can reuse the components we've already made.

4. **Scalability**:As the app gets bigger, having small, separate parts (Components) makes it easier to add new features without everything getting messed up.
